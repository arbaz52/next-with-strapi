# [Next](https://nextjs.org/) with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
**VERSION: 2.0**

[VISIT LIVE DEMO!](https://rstorer.herokuapp.com/)

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) store, displays a list of products that the user can add to cart and checkout using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
## TODO
Will build this project in multiple milestones.
- **Version 1.0:** First one is creating a home page where users can purchase my CV/Resume for a price using stripe.
- **Version 2.0:** Next step is to implement [https://fakestoreapi.com/](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and convert this to a e-commerce store with carting system just like [arbaz52/next-redux-local-storage](https://github.com/arbaz52/next-redux-local-storage).
